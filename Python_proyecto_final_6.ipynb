The\n","    builtin open function is defined in this module.\n","    \n","    At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It\n","    defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no\n","    separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are\n","    allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.\n","    \n","    Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and\n","    writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide\n","    an interface to OS files.\n","    \n","    BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its\n","    subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer\n","    streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.\n","    BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access\n","    streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.\n","    \n","    Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding\n","    of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text\n","    interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO\n","    is an in-memory stream for text.\n","    \n","    Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments\n","    of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.\n","    \n","    data:\n","    \n","    DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE\n","    \n","       An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered\n","       I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if\n","       possible.\n","\n","CLASSES\n","    _io._BufferedIOBase(_io._IOBase)\n","        _io.BufferedRWPair\n","        _io.BufferedRandom\n","        _io.BufferedReader\n","        _io.BufferedWriter\n","        _io.BytesIO\n","        BufferedIOBase(_io._BufferedIOBase, IOBase)\n","    _io._IOBase(builtins.object)\n","        IOBase\n","            BufferedIOBase(_io._BufferedIOBase, IOBase)\n","            RawIOBase(_io._RawIOBase, IOBase)\n","            TextIOBase(_io._TextIOBase, IOBase)\n","    _io._RawIOBase(_io._IOBase)\n","        _io.FileIO\n","        RawIOBase(_io._RawIOBase, IOBase)\n","    _io._TextIOBase(_io._IOBase)\n","        _io.StringIO\n","        _io.TextIOWrapper\n","        TextIOBase(_io._TextIOBase, IOBase)\n","    builtins.OSError(builtins.Exception)\n","        builtins.BlockingIOError\n","        UnsupportedOperation(builtins.OSError, builtins.ValueError)\n","    builtins.ValueError(builtins.Exception)\n","        UnsupportedOperation(builtins.OSError, builtins.ValueError)\n","    \n","    class BlockingIOError(OSError)\n","     |  I/O operation would block.\n","     |  \n","     |  Method resolution order:\n","     |      BlockingIOError\n","     |      OSError\n","     |      Exception\n","     |      BaseException\n","     |      object\n","     |  \n","     |  Methods defined here:\n","     |  \n","     |  __init__(self, /, *args, **kwargs)\n","     |      Initialize self.

The 'x' mode implies 'w' and\n","        raises an `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.\n","        \n","        Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,\n","        even when the underlying operating system doesn't.

In text mode (the default, or when\n","        't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are\n","        returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a\n","        platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.\n","        \n","        'U' mode is deprecated and will raise an exception in future versions\n","        of Python.

When no buffering argument is\n","        given, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n","        \n","        * Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer\n","          is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's\n","          \"block size\" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.\n","          On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n","        \n","        * \"Interactive\" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)\n","          use line buffering.

Pass\n","        'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error\n","        (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore\n","        errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)\n","        See the documentation for codecs.register or run 'help(codecs.Codec)'\n","        for a list of the permitted encoding error strings.\n","        \n","        newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text\n","        mode).

Lines in the input can end in '\\n', '\\r', or '\\r\\n', and\n","          these are translated into '\\n' before being returned to the\n","          caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line\n","          endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of\n","          the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given\n","          string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n","        \n","        * On output, if newline is None, any '\\n' characters written are\n","          translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If\n","          newline is '' or '\\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any\n","          of the other legal values, any '\\n' characters written are translated\n","          to the given string.\n","        \n","        If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open\n","        when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given\n","        and must be True in that case.\n","        \n","        A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as *opener*. The\n","        underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by\n","        calling *opener* with (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open\n","        file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener* results in functionality\n","        similar to passing None).\n","        \n","        open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and\n","        through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing\n","        are performed.
